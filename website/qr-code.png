# QR Code Image Placeholder

This file should be replaced with your actual QR code image.

The website is now configured to use this image file (qr-code.png) instead of generating QR codes dynamically.

To use your QR code:
1. Replace this file with your QR code image
2. Make sure it's named "qr-code.png"
3. The image should be approximately 200x200 pixels for best display

The website will automatically load and display your QR code image.
