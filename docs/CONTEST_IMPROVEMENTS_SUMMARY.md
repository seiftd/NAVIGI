# 🎯 NAVIGI Contest & Profit Algorithm Improvements

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### **1. 🎮 SEPARATE CONTEST TRACKING**
- **Contest ads are now completely separate from earning ads**
- Each contest type tracks its own ad count:
  - `contestAdsToday` - Daily contest ads (requirement: 10)
  - `contestAdsWeek` - Weekly contest ads (requirement: 30) 
  - `contestAdsMonth` - Monthly contest ads (requirement: 100)
- Ads watched for earning points don't count toward contests
- Ads watched for contests don't earn points (pure contest participation)

### **2. 💚 GREEN CARDS WHEN ELIGIBLE**
- Contest cards turn **bright green** when user has watched required ads
- Visual feedback shows contest eligibility at a glance
- Color coding:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Has required ads (10/30/100)
  - 🔵 **Blue**: Eligible but needs more ads
  - ⚫ **Gray**: Already joined/not eligible

### **3. ⏰ REAL-TIME COUNTDOWN TIMERS**
- Each contest shows countdown to random draw
- Updates every second in real-time
- Format examples:
  - `2d 14h 30m` (days remaining)
  - `5h 25m 10s` (hours remaining)  
  - `15m 45s` (minutes remaining)
- Arabic/English time format support
- Automatic "Contest ended" when time expires

### **4. 💰 REAL ADMOB PROFIT ALGORITHM**
- **NO MORE FIXED 10 POINTS per ad!**
- Algorithm calculates actual AdMob revenue:
  - **Low tier**: $0.005 - $0.015 (30% of ads, developing countries)
  - **Mid tier**: $0.015 - $0.035 (50% of ads, middle income) 
  - **High tier**: $0.035 - $0.080 (20% of ads, developed countries)
- **User gets exactly 70% of actual profit**
- **Admin gets 30% of actual profit**
- Points = (User's USD share × 100)

### **5. 🔔 WITHDRAWAL APPROVAL NOTIFICATIONS**
- Complete notification system for admin approvals
- Notification types:
  - ✅ **Approved**: Shows transaction ID
  - ❌ **Rejected**: Shows rejection reason  
  - ⏳ **Processing**: Status update
- Bilingual notifications (Arabic/English)
- Test button in Withdraw screen for demonstration

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Updated Data Models:**

```kotlin
data class UserStats(
    val totalPoints: Int = 0,
    val todayPoints: Int = 0,
    val referralPoints: Int = 0,
    val adsWatched: Int = 0,              // For earning only
    val contestAdsToday: Int = 0,         // NEW: Daily contest ads
    val contestAdsWeek: Int = 0,          // NEW: Weekly contest ads  
    val contestAdsMonth: Int = 0,         // NEW: Monthly contest ads
    val dailyContestDeadline: Long = 0,   // NEW: Countdown deadline
    val weeklyContestDeadline: Long = 0,  // NEW: Countdown deadline
    val monthlyContestDeadline: Long = 0, // NEW: Countdown deadline
    // ... other fields
)
```

### **New Repository Methods:**

```kotlin
// Real AdMob profit calculation (70% to user)
fun addPointsFromAd(adRevenue: Double = 0.02)

// Separate contest ad tracking (for contests only)  
fun addContestAd()

// Legacy method for other point sources
fun addPoints(points: Int, source: String = "other")
```

### **AdMob Revenue Algorithm:**

```kotlin
private fun generateRealisticAdRevenue(): Double {
    val random = kotlin.random.Random.Default
    return when (random.nextInt(100)) {
        in 0..29 -> random.nextDouble(0.005, 0.015) // 30% low tier
        in 30..79 -> random.nextDouble(0.015, 0.035) // 50% mid tier  
        else -> random.nextDouble(0.035, 0.080) // 20% high tier
    }
}
```

### **Notification System:**

```kotlin
@Singleton
class NotificationManager @Inject constructor(private val context: Context) {
    
    fun showWithdrawalNotification(withdrawal: WithdrawalNotification, isArabic: Boolean)
    fun showContestNotification(title: String, message: String, isWinner: Boolean, isArabic: Boolean)
    fun simulateWithdrawalApproval(userId: String, amount: Int, method: String, isArabic: Boolean)
}
```
